Difference between SPLICE and SLICE                                                                               SPLICE is used to add or remove items in the original array and the changes are reflected in the original array.while SLICE is used to get a new array from an orignal array and the changes are not reflected in the original array.                                                                                                              The return value of a SPLICE array is the array containing the deleted element which takes 'n' numbers of arguments.while the rturn value of a SLICE array is a new array with the values in the selected array of the given array. The value in the range takes exactly 2 arguments. 
Difference betwen FILTER INDEXOF FIND and INCLUDE                                                                   FILTER is used tofilter all elements and return the elements that matches and the those that dont matches are removed. FIND is used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfy the conditions provided . INDEXOF is used to look for items starting from index(from) and returns the index of which the element was found.it uses the === forcomparison. The INCLUDE is used to look for items starting from index(from) and it returns true if elementfound.  
DIFFIRENCE BETWEEN SUBSTRING AND SUBSTR                                                                             The parameters for substr()are start and length while for substring() they are startand end. substr start index will wrap to the end of the string if it is negative. while substring will clamp it to 0.
